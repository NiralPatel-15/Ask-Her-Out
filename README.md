# 💖 Ask Her Out 💖

A fun, cute, and playful web project where saying **“No”** is… well… not really an option 😄  
Built using simple **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** with adorable animations and images.

---

## ✨ Features

- 💌 Romantic & funny proposal flow
- ❌ “No” button changes behavior every time
- 😈 After multiple “No” clicks, the button moves away and becomes unclickable
- ✅ Clicking “Yes” always leads to the happy ending
- 🎀 Cute images and emotional messages on each step
- 🌸 Clean pastel UI

---

## 🧠 How It Works

1. First page asks: **“Do you love me?”**
2. Clicking **No**:
   - 1st time → opens Page 2  
   - 2nd time → opens Page 3  
   - 3rd time → opens Page 4  
3. On the last page:
   - ❌ No button starts moving and cannot be clicked
   - ✅ Yes button is always clickable
4. Clicking **Yes** opens the final love page 💕
